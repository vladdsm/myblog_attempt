## What a strange world we live in

Motivation of this blog post is only about to describe the situation we live in and make few thoughts on what to do going forward!

### Resuming to write a blog

It has been a while since my last contribution to this blog and the online area overall. 
Nevertheless, why not to resume by reviewing the situation while coming back to online digital project!?

#### Huge break

Due to few reasons of personal and professional life, there was a huge break where no 'commits' has been made.
While that break, things were not stopped but evolving. 

#### Keeping up with motivation

That is why it is enough to make a first step and resume things going forward!
Thing is - it is also not so easy to resume while having a thought that there is 'something not finished' may keep depressing feelings...

### What is actually happening

In a summary, there are quite a few distruptive things going on which will be further shortly explained

#### Technological distruption

We have quite some advancements of Artificial Intelligence (chatGPT) , crypto-related technologies, communications, Electric vehicles.
These are quite some advancements we may need to consider. More over , there seems to be a race about who will be first here!

#### High economical instability

There is a very high economical volatility going on. Increasing inflation, higher cost of money, growing debts.

#### Strange climate

Short term weather records would definitely show that pattern of significant changes. 
It seems that we may have a colder summer and warmer winter, stronger winds and weaker rivers (or opposite of that kind). 
Some people would be happy to have that but some don't:

There are people who are loosing ski-pass ticket sales, and... there are people who are forced to save money on a heating bill

### What should we expect and how to react

Definitely, there are quite some opportunities and things to avoid.

#### Adapt

Electric car as a way to reduce transportation costs?
Using chatGPT to avoid consulting laywers?
Or may be switching snow sport to cycling or hiking?

#### Opportunity to win

Technology does often requires capital to do the research and investment into development.
These companies would need to borrow the capital and going public IPO.
Many would look to enter early to set the bet on success of that technologies companies

#### Be optimistic healthy and positive

As the health costs are increasing - it's the best time to invest into your own health.
Moderated sport makes you feel good and reduces stress.
Enjoy the forest and note that it was there for thousand years and even if one tree is falling down...
... there will be many more to take available sun light!
