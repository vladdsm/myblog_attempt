## How important is to be consistent to be successful

Motivation of this blog post is to discuss how to maintain consistency in our everyday life to be successful.

Which factors help to be consistent?

Which factors will lead to inconsistency?

Where is the holy grail of consistency?

### Why this can be important

It seems very obvious that success is not coming from one single time playing loto and winning jackpot million.
There are many examples from nature, industry, sociology that consistency is important, however...

- consistency means routine!

- routines are boring and not for everyone!

- boring things are painful

- painful things are easy to forget

- to forget is the brain's mechanism to cope with pain

Is it really possible to be consistent ??

#### Which factors improve consistency

Let's discuss this using some examples from nature and industry

##### Growing tomatoes

This would require regular watering, caring to cut sprouts, maintaining right growth direction.
Sometimes it is necessary to cut big branches (risk) to make sure only one or maximum two shafts are going up.
Best result had to be prepared in advance to cope with weather (green - house). 
External factors like cold weather will make things more challenging
Not forgetting about space, there should be enough to grow sideways and upwards
Last but not least, fertilizers and pesticides are something to consider too!

##### Manufacturing

Manufacturing process requires sound design to produce consistent results.
Process needs maintenance to control tolerances of the final product
One need to study about which parameters are best for the right quality
Control key process parameters and adjust the process is required too

##### Sleeping patterns and health

Regular sleeping pattern helps to be more productive and healty
It is also necessary to sleep enough but sleeping excessively long does not help either!


#### Which factors lead to inconsistency

Let's discuss this using some examples from nature and industry

- Changing in temperature patterns can destroy crops and even estinct some species
- Having not finished tasks at work will fire back with stress and bad results
- Not enjoying the process or not having motivation to do so is bringing above mentioned pain
- Obstacles on the way, like regular maintenance, losses, the need to discard bad products
- Complexity in tasks making it absolutely horrible to remember or making mistakes when doing

#### What is the holy grail of consistency

Let's try to boil down the formula of holy grail:

- Make it fun and positive
- Document the process in very detail
- Reduce complexity as much as possible
- Set Reminders
- Dedicate a quality time for your routine
- Make your brain work for you, visualize work
- Oxygenate and hydrate your brain to help (i.e. glass of water every hour + 1 min run)
- Automate as much as you can
- Reward your brain to help maintaining consistency (if I complete this then I get a reward)
- Motivate yourself with the result
- Define yourself time and risk frame
- Celebrate achievement
- Setup multiple routines
- Continuously innovate within your routine

### Lets make another prove that this tactic work

#### Setup goal

Setup the goal and plan to what needs to be achieved:

- make consistent routines for one year
- use defined routines, tips, documentation, etc
- celebrate results

### Conclusion

It is extremely hard to be consistent especially if handling very complex tasks.
Well documented process, routine reminders, success along the way will motivate consistency
Too complex, poorly described manual tasks, bad results will your consistency and never deliver result
